This is a Masters project titled "Twitter User Community Classification" and was done to categorize users on the social media platform Twitter and determine who they represent. The representations are academic, business, media, and citizen.

The data is run against a training set, and processed to obtain a bag of words. It is then tested against a test set with a few machine learning algorithms like KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

The factors used to classify the users on Twitter are:

1. The tweets that the user posts

2. The profile description

3. The Twitter user they follow

4. Friends ( User follows another user who follows back )
